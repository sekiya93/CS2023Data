# CS2023Data


## OBJECTIVE

This is a package of scripts and data for analysing a text based on the Body of Knowledge (BOK) of CS2023 [CS2023]. Outputs consist of the rates in 17 Knowledge Area (KA)s of CS2023.

## FILE

* analyze_documents_with_CS2023.py
The script to analyse a text. This uses lda-c [LDA] internally.
* final.model.text
The model obtained by analyzing CS2023. This was extracted by ssLDA [ssLDA] and is used by the lda-c.
* settings.conf  
The parameters used by LDA.
* word.csv  
3304 words in CS2023 BOK.

## PROCEDURE

1. Set up the Python environment.
2. Install lda-c from https://github.com/blei-lab/lda-c/
3. Place the following files in a working directory.  
`analyze_documents_with_CS2023.py, word.csv, settings.conf, final.model.text`
4. Place target files in `target_dir`.
5. Run the following command in the directory.  
`./analyze_with_CS2013.pl --target target_dir`
6. Results are in `{target_dir}result.csv`.
